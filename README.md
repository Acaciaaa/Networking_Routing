# Networking_Routing
This is a lab from Computer Networking: implementing the distance vector routing protocol, and the details are presented in Assignment.pdf

Tutorial1 and Tutorial2 describe the whole process - the agent, a centralized control agent, triggering the route updates of the routers; TestCases are simple cases for debugging and test.py is an automated test script; And assignment3_routing is the final project (no original template offered)

Because of unpredictable time every router may take, the main task is to make sure that agent will not start the next round untill it receives enough responses.
